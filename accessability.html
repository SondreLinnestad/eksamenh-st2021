                Developing our code
            </h1>
            <p class="part1">
                We really wanted to integrate as much accessibility as possibly. This was something we though off when 
                we started developing and designing the website. So naturally we started with designing the website. We 
                focused on what we wanted to achieve withour design, we wanted it to be easy to read. Our thought process behind it was 
                that absolutely everything should be accessed and understood by the majority of all people, regardless 
                age and disability. Something most unexperienced web designers don’t think of is that a
                 webpage needs to be dynamic in order to be accessible on all devices such as a PC, phone, iPad etc. Therefore, 
                 we have implemented changes in the CSS. Here is an example of how we made our code accessable to other devices, like
                 tablets.

                Automated code test
            </h1>
            <img src="accessability test.png" alt="test results" class="test">
            <p class="part2">
                We also used an automated test, in order to check the accessibility throughout the whole project. We ran 
                the website through the test and made sure errors were solved. But there is only so much an automated test 
                can do, you can't 100% rely on those tests, it better to use them as a “spellchecker”. It works well because 
                it may catch things humans don’t, like text size, text contrast, issues with navigating, issues with menu,
                 checking the spacing between things etc, but you have to go through everything manually as well. In addition 
                 to the automated tests, we also ran our website through more manual testing, with a variety of tools, to 
                 simulate high contrast, low contrast and, vision impairments and zoom. Here we have added a picture of one the  
                 test we tested on our code.

            As mentioned earlier, accessibility was one of our main topics when we worked on this design. We thought 
            about how it should look, but we also thought about the back end of the webpage. It was important to us 
            that we had a solid webpage, we needed to have a well-structured code. Our main thought process behind the
             majority of the code was that we wanted to write in an order, things that was at the top of the page were 
             also at the top of the code. This way it’s a lot easier to maintain it, correct errors or implement new changes.
