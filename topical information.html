                Fake news
            </h1>
            <p class="part1">The term fake news is constantly thrown around to the point that it is difficult to define what it 
                means. A clear example of this is how Donald Trump uses the term to reject negative news or news he disliked. 
                However, there are some common characteristics that can help us define what fake news actually is. Our group 
                came up with the follow characteristics for fake news:
                <br>
                <br>
                - Fake news spread fast.
                <br>
                - The information is manipulated to reach a certain goal.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most prominent characteristic of fake news is its ability to spread fast. This is because it is made with 
                intentions to spread fast. They often do this by talking about controversial or trending topics that often trigger
                 strong emotions. Examples of this are the supposed “dangers” of the corona vaccines or building of 5g towers.
                Fake news is made to reach a certain goal. The goals fake news usually aims to achieve can be broken down to two 
                things. Persuading the reader to believe something. Examples of this are fake news about Donald Trump in attempt to 
                harm his reputation or fitness influencers trying to sell their revolutionary health products. The other is to make 
                money such as by ad revenue or selling a service or product. Both of which is achieved by reaching as many readers as 
                possible by spreading as fast as possible. As you probably noticed most of the characteristics intertwine and build
                 upon each other. Therefore, our concluding definition of what qualifies as fake news is “News or information made 
                 intentionally to spread fast to attain a certain goal “.

                What can we do?

                The factors that we found to be the most difficult 
                to do something about was democratization of media and writing for clicks. The solution that one of the group 
                members talked about was regulating and restricting the fake news. However, this solution has a serious flaw and that
                 is that it restricts a fundamental human right, and that is freedom of speech and expression. Controlling and 
                 filtering what kind of information people are allowed to post or share might minimize incorrect information. 
                 But it also has the potential power of restricting correct information. The violation of human right, 
                 potential of abuse from the authorities and human is what makes it hard to do something about these factors.
                 There are two factors that build upon similar concepts and these two are confirmation bias or echo chamber 
                 and the battle for our cognitive resources. These build on the fact that we are not seeking or presented 
                 accurate information. Either due to the algorithm of social media or lack of time to check out the truth. 
                 However, a potential solution of this does exist, and that is making the correct information come you. 
                 Instagram has implemented a feature where if you search up or the algorithm shows you a topic that potentially 
                 has a lot of misinformation, Instagram will show links to trustful sources of information about said topic.
