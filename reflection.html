                We are all from different small cities around Norway. We are used to small villages where we all know each 
                other. Classes were small, we knew everybody there, and we usually knew their whole family as well. It was 
                just a small community, a bubble in a way. When we moved to a bigger city to a university the difference struck
                 us momentarily. Our small classes were no longer small, we didn’t know anybody, and our small “bubble” was broken. 
                 For me the transitioning was kind of rough. I went from knowing everyone in the class of twenty people, to not 
                 knowing one, in a classroom of hundreds of students. The new university was huge compared to the old school.
                  Normally I would know what classroom I should get to, now the hallways felt like big mazes and the huge 
                  auditoriums felt like a scene.After a while all the new things became the new normal. The huge classes 
                  weren't that big, the endless hallways, were no longer mazes, hundreds of unknown people started to be 
                  known and the auditoriums were no longer big scenes.

                When we all became a bit more comfortable in the big city, we really started to focus on the courses we had at 
                school. Most of them contained a form of programming, either html, CSS or java. Some of us had tried to learn 
                some basics of python a few months before starting at this program, but it was a bit hard, so we thought we
                 would get to really learn when we started at a proper programming course.But our main problem was how we 
                 didn’t really have a plan on learning all this new stuff, we didn’t really know how learning in a big 
                 university work. You watch some lectures, do some assignments, read on your own and basically do everything 
                 yourself. I think many of us weren't ready for being fully in charge of our own learning. We just didn’t 
                 expect such a big change from our upper- secondary school to the university.As we came into the rhythm of 
                 the learning format, we learned more and more about programming. And we started to value how we were in 
                 charge of everything we did. We could fully control our day- to-day life, and spend time on things we needed 
                 to do, or some days we could do anything we would like to do.

            As we started to program, it became more and more difficult. Some assignments looked impossible at the start, 
            but when we tried different things, we started to understand more. Small changes could make or break a big project. 
            When we had new projects, we instantly tried to experiment with the code we had available. Because everything is 
            essentially learned by trial and error.
